# The CSS Challenges

## Basic
* [ ] SMACSS

* [X] SCSS

## Intermediate
* [X] CSS-only navigation menu
  * [X] 3 levels of menus
  * [ ] Responsive
    * [ ] No hover, but click

* [ ] Responsiveness and media queries: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#Media_types

* [ ] Advanced units https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp

* [ ] Flexbox

* [ ] Advanced selectors
  * [X] Automatically set to red all buttons that have "delete" in them
  * [X] Rounded-border buttons that lose roundness when put together.

* [ ] Chained selectors:
  * [ ] Bargraph. On hover over the items in the key, the corresponding columns are highlighted.

* [ ] CSS ::before and ::after

* [ ] Dynamic properties
  * [ ] `calc`

* [ ] Adavanced SCSS:
  * [ ] Mixins
  * [ ] Variables
  * [ ] Predefined functions http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html
    * [ ] http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html
      * [ ] Color-mixing functions: mix, hsl, adjust-hue, lighten, darken, saturate, desaturate, grayscale, complement, invert
      * [ ] Numeric functions: percentage, round, min, max, random

## Advanced
* [ ] Purely parametric page style
  * [ ] Colour is set in a SCSS variable, and applied to different parts using colour-mixing functions
  * [ ] Padding/margin/whitespace is set in a SCSS variable, and applied to different parts using calc and general SCSS functions

* [ ] Futuristic UI
  * [ ] Slow animated deploy of page

* [ ] 3D
  * [ ] Test transparency (the final color depends on the order of the rendered elements)
    * [ ] Test svg-based transparency
    * [ ] Test png-based transparency

* [ ] Animations

* [ ] CSS-only confirmation for buttons
  * [ ] Click/hover over button, deploy secondary frame with confirm delete

* [ ] CSS-only browser kicker
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports
  * [ ] Disable page if browser does not support a specific CSS characteristic
  * [ ] Cross-browser datetime-local component that uses native datetime-local for browsers that support it or a custom JS/react thinguie for browsers that do not support it

* [ ] nav-index, nav-down, nav-up - Keyboard-only navigation system

* [ ] Selector to select parent
  * Apparently it's impossible.
